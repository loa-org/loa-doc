\chapter{Toolchain}

\section{Simulation}
GHDL is the baseline for simulation, the corresponding waveform-viewer is GtkWave, preferably use the Makefiles to operate the two.

Xilinx iSim can be used if Verilog and VHDL code have to executed in a shared simulation \footnote{Not require at the moment.}.

\section{IDE \& Editors}
Use an editor with code highlighting, and preferably with auto-indent function, Emacs with VHDL-mode\footnote{There is a shellscript in the Loa repository to setup EMACS.} or Eclipse with one of the plug-ins is recommended.

\section{Synthesis}
For the Xilinx Spartan3 and Spartan6 FPGAs Xilinx's ISE with WebPack license is recommended. At the time of writing version 14.5 is known to be working.
